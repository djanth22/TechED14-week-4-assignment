Reflection
Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

Required
-🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
-🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
-🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Optional
-🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

-Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
-What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g YouTube tutorials)?
-What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
-What went really well and what could have gone better?

what I achieved:
-my html form submits data to the database.
-the project is functional with multiple screen sizes but mainly due to the styling so I wouldnt say this is 100% for this one.
-I have GET and POST endpoints for dealing with retrieving and adding data to and from the database and the client.
-I also added some dummy data to be dislayed on the screen, though I did this in the seed.js file as opposed to the sql editor in supabase.

I spent most of my time attempting to fix annoying errors I've dealt with previously and trying to get things to work how I expected. Render definitely is something i would want to do a bit more work on so that I can get some things to work that I couldn't manage to get properly implemented, such as the background images.
